# Assignment Form Bug Debug Guide

## Problem Description
User reported that in Assignment -> Users -> Edit, the following controls are not working:
- Active User checkbox
- Administrator checkbox 
- Password field

## Debug Changes Made
I've added console.log debug statements to track the issue:

1. **handleEditUser function**: Shows user data being loaded into form
2. **Checkbox onChange handlers**: Shows when checkboxes are clicked and values change
3. **Password onChange handler**: Shows when password field is modified
4. **handleCreateUser function**: Shows final form data being sent to backend

## How to Test

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd "d:\CodeThue\SystemMail\mail-server"
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend  
   cd "d:\CodeThue\SystemMail"
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the form:**
   - Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000
   - Login as admin
   - Go to Assignment tab
   - Find any user and click the Edit button (yellow pencil icon)
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to Console tab
   - Try these actions and watch console output:
     - Click the "Active User" checkbox
     - Click the "Administrator" checkbox
     - Type something in the Password field
     - Click "Update User" button

3. **Check console logs:**
   Look for logs starting with ðŸ”§:
   - `ðŸ”§ handleEditUser called with user:` - shows user being edited
   - `ðŸ”§ User isAdmin:` and `isActive:` - shows original values
   - `ðŸ”§ Setting userForm to:` - shows form being populated
   - `ðŸ”§ isActive checkbox changed to:` - shows checkbox clicks
   - `ðŸ”§ isAdmin checkbox changed to:` - shows checkbox clicks
   - `ðŸ”§ Password field changed to:` - shows password typing
   - `ðŸ”§ handleCreateUser called` - shows form submission
   - `ðŸ”§ Current userForm state:` - shows final form data

## Expected Behavior
- Checkboxes should be checked/unchecked based on user's current isAdmin/isActive values
- Clicking checkboxes should change their state and show in console
- Typing in password field should show in console
- Form submission should include correct isAdmin/isActive values

## Potential Issues to Look For
1. **Data loading issue**: If user data doesn't have isAdmin/isActive fields properly
2. **State update issue**: If checkbox clicks don't trigger state updates
3. **API issue**: If backend doesn't receive the correct data
4. **UI rendering issue**: If checkboxes appear unchecked even when they should be checked

## Next Steps
After testing, report what you see in the console logs so I can identify exactly where the problem occurs.
